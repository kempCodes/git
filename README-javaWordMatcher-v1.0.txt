-------------------------------------------------------------- Name:
Word Matching Version: 1.0 Free Use Author: @kempCodes -- Kemper Lee
-------------------------------------------------------------- **How to
use this program:**
-------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Enter
a String value - numbers, spaces, and punctuation allowed 2. Enter a
second String value - again, all characters allowed 3. Get results on
whether the Strings are equal - capital letters are accounted for, A ==
a, etc. - spaces matter(even at the front/end), "Jack" != " Jack "
--------------------------------------------------------------
**Expected outcomes**
-------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Equal
Strings - first String value entered printed in Console 2. Not-equal
Strings - String "No Match" in Console
--------------------------------------------------------------
